# FFT-Based-Real-Time-Audio-Frequency-Analysis-Pipeline-Using-Kafka-FFT-Cassandra-and-Airflow
A real-time audio analysis pipeline captures audio, applies FFT to extract frequency data, streams results via Kafka, and stores them in Cassandra. Airflow orchestrates the process, enabling automated and scalable frequency analytics.
